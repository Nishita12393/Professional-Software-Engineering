using average function from numpy library.
The numpy.average(temp) calculates the average of all the temperatures.
Using round which is a bult-in function of python
round(..., 2) rounds it to 2 decimal places.
numpy.max(temp) finds the highest temperature.
numpy.min(temp) finds the lowest temperature
f is an empty list that will store Fahrenheit values.
indexes is another list that will store the day numbers (by index) when the temperature was above 20°C.for idx, x in enumerate(temp):

for idx, x in enumerate(temp):
using for Loop through each temperature using enumerate a builtin function of python that keeps track of index and loop over the list
idx gives the index (position) — starts at 0.
x gives the temperature value.

y = x * 9/5 + 32
    f.append(y)
converting the temperature from celsius to farenheit using the above formula
append add the converted Fahrenheit temperature (y) to the list f.

if(x > 20):
        indexes.append(idx + 1)
If the temperature is above 20°C and it adds the day index (idx + 1) to the indexes list
Because index starts from 0 whereas days start from 1 to show the day i added 
+1.

integers.shape is used to give the size and structure of the array.
integers.dtype is used to give the type of data stored in the array.
I multiplyied each element in the array by 2 using to give the each element in double as per question.



File activity2.py
For the average score of each student, I used average function of python in scores array 
student_average = np.round(np.average(scores, 1),2)
In 2 dimension array 1 denotes x axis and 0 denotes y axis. For the round of the each element in array i used round library of numpy.
And same logic has been used for subject array.
argmax function gives the index of maximum value in the array.  

: means all rows 
-1 means the last column as in python negative indices count from the end.
